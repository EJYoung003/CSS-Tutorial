This tutorial on Drop Caps and Paragraph Text Effects can be found at the url above this paragraph. 
This website, Design Shack, has many tutorial on the use of CSS, HTML, and various other items. 
This particular article focused on using CSS to create drop caps and formatting paragraph text effects. 
Using the CSS that you are shown here can help you to make your web page stand out by drawing the viewer's
eye exactly where you want it to go by keeping your text interesting.

The article was posted by JAKE ROCHELEAU ON:12 MAR 2014.  I liked the article because it was informative
and easy to follow.  This is important to someone who is just starting out using HTML and CSS.  I found
the language to be put together in a way that would appeal to someone with minimal knowledge in this area.

The page had a vast amount of information on ways to format your text, whether you were just looking to
format a paragraph element, blockquotes, lists, and symbols.  There are some very good examples of how
the CSS should look and some good examples of what the HTML of the page looked like that he used to illustrate
how the changes were implemented.  This will be a site that I will use for reference in the future.
